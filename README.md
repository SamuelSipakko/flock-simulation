# flock-simulation

This application is a **Java** 2D implementation of flock simulation. Alignment, cohesion and separation are used along with border forces to determine the movement of boids. While running the app, the control panel on right side of the GUI can be used to control forces and different settings.

This application is build by using *IntelliJ IDEA* and uses JavaFX as GUI library.

A side note: The app lacks optimization so the maximum number of boids is limited.
